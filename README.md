# Hi there, I'm Riho Luik! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on many FNF Mods that I own and manage, Vs SDN REBOOT, FNF Cadence and many old ones that I'm remastering so far.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT @ VIKK + Game Development in PyGame.
- 🎨 My hobbies consist of: Drawing, Making music, Coding and playing games from time to time.
- ⚡ Fun fact: When it comes to games, movies or any sort of media then I'm one heck of a sucker for them! 😊💜

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- 💻 Languages: Python, a little bit of Haxe/Flixel & Lua and _maybe_ some Scratch _(I don't use Scratch as much)_
- 🧰 Tools: Ableton Live 12 Suite & FL Studio 21 (for making music), Clip Studio Paint (for drawing), Adobe Animate (for animating), PyCharm (for Python coding) and Phoenix Code (for general coding)
